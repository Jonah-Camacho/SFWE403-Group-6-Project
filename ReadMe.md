# This program requires Node to be installed.

A bash script is included in the files. It is good practice to read the script before executing. The script will install install dependencies when needed, otherwise it will start the server. 

## To install and/or run the server using the script:
```
./start.sh
```
## If you prefer to not use the script
### Installation: 
```
npm install
```
### Run the Server:
```
npm run dev
```
