## 10. Suggested Maintenance / Update Instructions

- Periodically (e.g. annually) check UA’s **Bursar / Tuition & Fees** pages to update cost figures. :contentReference[oaicite:72]{index=72}  
- Monitor UA Online program pages (Software Engineering BS, MS, PhD) for changes in credit cost, admission requirements, or course structure. :contentReference[oaicite:73]{index=73}  
- Track catalog updates in the UA Course Catalog (e.g. `catalog.arizona.edu`) for formal curriculum changes especially in the SFWE, ECE, and graduate catalogs.  
- Refresh FAQ answers based on policy changes (e.g. GRE requirement, funding, program fees).  
- Where possible, link this chatbot knowledge base to official UA APIs or web scrapers to surface real-time updates (e.g. tuition calculator, catalog JSON).  
- Include versioning (e.g. “Last Updated: YYYY-MM”) so users know how stale the data may be.
